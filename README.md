# Netguard
This started as a fork of [NetGuard's native code](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/tree/master/app/src/main/jni/netguard) used in our App Tracking Protection feature.
Now it has expanded to contain much more functionality.

The API of this repository is not stable, we may change it when needed. The code is fully production code.
